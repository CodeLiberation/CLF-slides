Remember if you want to use a sensor (by calling analogRead(pinNumber)) from Arduino that you change the build settings > player settings > other settings to use .net 2.0 vs the subset 

Also - the serial monitor might fight you a bit - make sure you have it closed in Arudino before running your game. If you don't, it will throw  an error about not being able to connect. 

A word to the wise. Hardware is kinda a bit buggy. Have to fear of unplugging and replugging in your arduino a bunch of times. That's fine. It's REALLY hard to break stuff. Be brave!
